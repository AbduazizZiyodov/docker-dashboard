# Welcome to contributing guide ✌️

I appreciate your contribution! I want to make contributing to this project as easy as possible, whether it's:
* Reporting a bug/security issue 🐞
* Proposing new features ✨
* Submitting some fixes 🔧

## Github is your friend 🧠

You are welcome to open pull requests.

* Just fork this repository 🍴
* If you made some changes, do not forget about adding tests 🧪
* Lint your code (e.g. I use black) 📄

I use GitHub for tracking public bugs. You can open any issue from the website easily.
> But, if you found serious security issues it is better to write through email (check SECURITY.md).


## Reporting bugs 🐛

* Write a specific problem/bug, and some summary ✅
* Include a sample of the code and a clear screenshot 🖥
* If you can, try to think about possible 💪

**Follow PEP8 rules.**
